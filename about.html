                <h3>About me</h3>  
                <p>I graduated from the University of East London with a BSc in Computer Games Development.
                Even though I had an artistic side, I chose the development path instead of the design due to her curiosity and interest in problem solving.
                After seeing how games impact people's lives, I decided to understand more about how to create and design them myself.
                The degree allowed me to obtain essential skills which enabled me to start a career as a software developer.
                I desire the developer path since it will enhance my abilities, knowledge and enable me to create more than just games.
                I want to be able to program and use a diverse range of technologies.</p>
